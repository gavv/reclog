.SH NAME
reclog \- Command\-line tool to capture command output to a file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]reclog\f[R] [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]] \f[I]COMMAND\f[R]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]reclog\f[R] runs specified command in a pty, connecting its own
stdin and stdout with pty\[aq]s input and output, without blocking the
command.
In addition, it duplicates pty\[aq]s output to a file, stripping out
ANSI escape codes.
.PP
It is similar to \f[B]unbuffer(1)\f[R] combined with \f[B]tee(1)\f[R]
and \f[B]ts(1)\f[R], but provides better user experience and robustness.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]\-H, \-\-header\f[R]
Before start, print header line (hostname, os, time, command).
.RS
.PP
Useful when you collect logs from different machines or invocations and
want to make them self\-describing.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-t, \-\-ts\f[R]
Prepend each line of the command output with current time.
.RS
.PP
This option enables behavior similar to \f[B]ts(1)\f[R].
It is useful when original program output does not include time
information.
.PP
How timestamps are calculated and formatted is defined by
\f[B]\-\-ts\-fmt\f[R] and \f[B]\-ts\-src\f[R] options.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-\-ts\-fmt\f[R] \f[I]FMT\f[R]
If \f[B]\-\-ts\f[R] is used, defines \f[B]strftime(3)\f[R] format
string.
.RS
.PP
Default format is \f[B]\[dq]%T%.3f\[dq]\f[R], which produces timestamps
like \[dq]01:02:03.123\[dq].
.PP
Documentation for the format specifiers can be found on docs.rs page of
Rust crate \[dq]chrono\[dq]
(\f[I]https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/\f[R]).
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-\-ts\-src\f[R] \f[I]SRC\f[R]
If \f[B]\-\-ts\f[R] is used, defines what timestamps to use: wallclock
(\f[I]wall\f[R]), elapsed time since program start (\f[I]elapsed\f[R]),
or delta between subsequent timestamps (\f[I]delta\f[R]).
.RS
.PP
Default source is \f[I]wall\f[R].
.PP
\f[I]wall\f[R], \f[I]elapsed\f[R], and \f[I]delta\f[R] values are
similar to \f[I]ts\f[R], \f[I]ts \-s\f[R], and \f[I]ts \-i\f[R] modes of
\f[B]ts(1)\f[R] command, respectively.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-o, \-\-output\f[R] \f[I]PATH\f[R]
Output file path.
.RS
.PP
If omitted, output path is generated automatically based on the command
basename (unless \f[B]\-\-null\f[R] is given).
E.g.
for \f[B]\[ga]reclog ls \-l\[aq]\f[R], the output file is
\f[I]ls.log\f[R].
.PP
Unless \f[B]\-\-force\f[R] or \f[B]\-\-append\f[R] option is given,
output file should not exist, otherwise an error is reported.
.PP
If \f[B]\-\-output\f[R] is omitted and \f[B]\-\-force\f[R] is not
specified as well, and generated path already exist, a numeric suffix is
automatically added to the path.
E.g.
if \f[I]ls.log\f[R] already exists, reclog will try \f[I]ls\-1.log\f[R],
\f[I]ls\-2.log\f[R], and so on.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-f, \-\-force\f[R]
Overwrite output file if it already exists.
.RS
.PP
See description for \f[B]\-\-output\f[R] option for details.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-a, \-\-append\f[R]
Append to output file if it already exists.
.RS
.PP
See description for \f[B]\-\-output\f[R] option for details.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-N, \-\-null\f[R]
Don\[aq]t write output file at all.
.RS
.PP
Has same effect as \f[I]\-\-output=/dev/null\f[R].
The output is still printed to stdout, unless \f[B]\-\-silent\f[R] is
specified.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-R, \-\-raw\f[R]
Don\[aq]t strip ANSI escape codes when writing to output file.
.RS
.PP
By default, reclog writes raw output to stdout and stripped output to
the \f[B]\-\-output\f[R] file.
With this option, this stripping is disabled.
This will preserve colors in the saved file, but makes it harder to
grep.
.PP
Stripping is performed via Rust crate \[dq]vte\[dq], a Rust
implementation of Paul Williams\[aq] ANSI parser state machine
(\f[I]https://docs.rs/vte/latest/vte/\f[R]).
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-s, \-\-silent\f[R]
Don\[aq]t print anything to stdout.
.RS
.PP
Has same effect as \f[B]\[ga]reclog ...
> /dev/null\[aq]\f[R].
The output is still printed to file, unless \f[B]\-\-null\f[R] is
specified.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-q, \-\-quit\f[R] \f[I]MILLISECONDS\f[R]
After EOF from command, wait the specified timeout (in milliseconds) and
then quit.
.RS
.PP
When child process exits, reclog continues reading pending output from
the pty until there is no data during the specified timeout.
This timeout can be very short, but should not be zero.
.PP
This allows to reliably fetch all buffered data before exiting.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-b, \-\-buffer\f[R] \f[I]LINES\f[R]
When stdout is slower than command output, buffer at max the specified
number of lines.
.RS
.PP
When command produces output faster than it can be written to
reclog\[aq]s stdout (typically if it is a terminal or pipe), reclog
starts buffering lines until the specified limit is reached.
When the buffer is full, the oldest lines are removed.
.PP
This allows to ensure that the command is never slowed down by
displaying logs, and hence even verbose logs don\[aq]t affect testing.
.PP
This option has no effect writing to \f[B]\-\-output\f[R] file, only
writing to reclog\[aq]s stdout.
Output file always receives the full output.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-\-man\f[R]
Print man page in troff format to stdout and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\-h, \-\-help\f[R]
Print help to stdout and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\-V, \-\-version\f[R]
Print version information to stdout and exit.
.SH SIGNALS
All standard job control and termination signals are propagated to the
child process group: \f[I]SIGTERM\f[R], \f[I]SIGINT\f[R],
\f[I]SIGHUP\f[R], \f[I]SIGQUIT\f[R], \f[I]SIGTSTP\f[R],
\f[I]SIGTTIN\f[R], \f[I]SIGTTOU\f[R], \f[I]SIGCONT\f[R],
\f[I]SIGWINCH\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Graceful termination: Hit \f[I]\[ha]C\f[R] (or send \f[I]SIGINT\f[R] or
\f[I]SIGTERM\f[R] or similar signal) to terminate the child process
gracefully and flush pending logs.
Hit \f[I]\[ha]C\f[R] second time to forcibly kill the child if it\[aq]s
stuck.
.IP \[bu] 2
Emergency termination: Hit \f[I]\[ha]\[rs]\f[R] (or send
\f[I]SIGQUIT\f[R]) for emergency termination without flushing the logs.
The child is given some short time to terminate properly, then is killed
forcibly.
.IP \[bu] 2
Pause/resume: Hit \f[I]\[ha]Z\f[R] (or send \f[I]SIGTSTP\f[R]) to pause.
Hit \f[I]\[ha]Z\f[R] second time to forcibly pause the child if it\[aq]s
stuck.
Type \f[I]fg\f[R] to resume.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.IP \[bu] 2
If system error happens (like file can\[aq]t be opened), reclog exits
with status \f[I]1\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
If usage error happens (like invalid option value), reclog exits with
status \f[I]2\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
If the specified command can\[aq]t be launched, reclog exits with status
\f[I]126\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
If the command exits with status \f[I]N\f[R], reclog exits with the same
status \f[I]N\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
If the command is killed by signal \f[I]N\f[R], reclog exits with the
status \f[I]128 + N\f[R].
.SH CAVEATS
.IP \[bu] 2
Invoked command should be a non\-interactive program that uses terminal
in canonical mode, otherwise things may happen.
.IP \[bu] 2
Invoked command should keep its child processes (if any) in the same
process group and with the same controlling TTY, otherwise they may not
be automatically terminated.
